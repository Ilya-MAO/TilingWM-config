# Ly supports 24-bit true color with styling, which means each color is a 32-bit value.
# The format is 0xSSRRGGBB, where SS is the styling, RR is red, GG is green, and BB is blue.
# Here are the possible styling options:
#define TB_BOLD      0x01000000
#define TB_UNDERLINE 0x02000000
#define TB_REVERSE   0x04000000
